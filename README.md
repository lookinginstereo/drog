Drog - A simple file/directory based blog

The goal of drog is to create a simple blog layout based on a directory structure
and json definition files. These directories will be picked up and packed into an
object that can then be queried and placed into templates. This will eventually
contain templates for examples.

Why files and directories? By keeping the blog data simple, we can take advantage
of Git to manage blog entries. This opens up the door for revision history, 
collaboration between contributors, branching and all the niceities afforded by 
source control.
